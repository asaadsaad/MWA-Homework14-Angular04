# MWA - Homework
Complete the frontend Angular application:
* Use Angular router and create two public sign-up and sign-in forms.
* Create a guard to proctect other routes and add an interceptor to attach your token to the request header. (make sure all requests have the JWT in the request header (use intercepter) so the backend API will approve the request, your frontend route should be protected with a Guard so only logged in users can access to private components).
* Complete all CRUD operations for courses at the frontend (Add course, Display a sinlge course, Update course)
